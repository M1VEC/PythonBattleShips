# PythonBattleShips
Goal:
Create a console based BattleShip game, player vs AI
The game will ask the user for a difficulty level and based on that will set
the board size, the number of boats and then at random place the boats on the board.

The player will then have n amount of guesses to try and destroy all the boats.

Todo:
***Verify the user guess number is within the max grid limits
**Give user the option to end game at any point
*push the game to a GUI
